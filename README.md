# Campaign Finance Dashboard

This project contains campaign finance data from OpenSecrets API, recording the information of all members of congress and the campaign contributions they recieved from the top 10 contributing industries. Search function is based on US state. 

## Headlines

I also used NewsAPI to draw top political reporting in the US into the home page.
